# C# Minebot

C# Minebot is the complete, ground up rewrite and successor to VB Minebot. 

C# Minebot utilizes the Wrapped socket library for connections with the server, and to handle all 
encrypted communications as well.

Currently supports Minecraft 1.4.7. does **NOT** support snapshots, and likely never will.

This project is only worked on in my free time, and thus is not in active development most of the time.

## Current Features

### IRC Proxy

C# Minebot can be used as a chat proxy between minecraft servers and IRC Channels. You can find the settings for what IRC server,
channel, and nickname you would like the bot to use. The settings save as you type them.
